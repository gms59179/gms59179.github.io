<h4><font face="Aerial" color="black" size="7"><b><u>Season Overview</b></u></font></h4>
<font face="Aerial" color="black" size="4">Last seaon ended in controversy with the firing of Coach Mark Richt
after a 15 year dynasty with the Bulldogs. UGA then hired Alabama's Defensive Coordinator Kirby Smart to take 
over the team and this gave dawg nation some much needed hope because of Alabama's recent winning seasons. Also adding
to the anticipation was the arrival of true Freshman quarterback Jacob Eason, the #1 prospect in the nation. Dawg 
fans felt like their hopes had been validated when we won the first three games in a row. These hopes then came to a
screeching halt with back to back losses to Ole Miss and Tennessee. Georgia's current record is 5-4 and fans have endured
a devastating season as we are still not bowl eligible. All attention has now been focused towards next year with Kirby Smart
and Jacob Eason entering their second years and hopefully bringing a more successful season.</font>
